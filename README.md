# Shaker

Shaker is a tools whose two principal functions :

1. Generate mail with combination of name, firstname, pseudo, postcode and date of birth
2. Check which mail exists on gmail or not.

Several options exists :

1. Simple mode : 0 to check only name and surname simple combinations without separator, 1 to check with separators, 2 to check all combinations.
2. Occurence : Change the default value of the number of occurence. By default : 2021
3. Birthday : Search the combinations based on the date of bith.
4. Provider : Adding providers to find more existing mails. Use stop to finish
5. Holehe : Launch the holehe function in the terminal if the mail is valid. 


**Warning** : For the moment, the program is not really fast, because I need to implement parallelizing features. So take a coffee (or two) if you're running a lot of providers at the same time. 

Future features : 

-> parallelizing

-> postcode
